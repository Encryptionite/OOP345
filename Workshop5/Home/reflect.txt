Workshop Reflection:
What I have learned: 
- How to pass a function object as a parameter.
- Using a lambda expression to convert grades.
- Implementing exceptions, with try, catch and throw operations.

Question 1 : The difference between the implementations of a functor and a lambda expression.

Answer: Functors can hold a state and can be used throughout the program whereas a lambda expressions can be used once in a parameter of another function. 
	If we want to reuse the lambda function we would have to assign it to a variable with auto however the
	context of the expression would have to change to depending on the implementation.


Question 2: A list of the exceptions that you have reported and the cases where you terminated execution normally.
Answer:


Error Code 1: Please enter two .txt filenames on the command line!!! 
	- The program wasn't passed two files.

Error Code 2: The number of elements received in the constructor is not positive-valued. 
	- Constructing object with a negative value.

Quiz Reflection: Got all answers correct.
