Workshop Reflection:

What I have learned: With completing this workshop I have learned how to utilize the chrono library.
		     This includes creating timepoint objects, duration casting, to successfully 
		     capture the length of time (duration) it took to perform a variety of function
		     calls. This workshop require me to program a move constructor and a move assignment 
	  	     operator which are new concepts to me, but with thorough research and some testing I 
	             was able to fully understand what they do, and how they were effectively used in my program. 
		     This workshop also required file reading which allowed me to refresh my memory on how
		     to perform the necessary operations (getline, seekg, fin.open, fin.eof, and fin.get).
	   	     

Question 1: The reason for the difference between the copy and move operations

Answer: Copy operations consist of copying one objects' resources to another object into a separate memory location, 
	whereas move operations consist of one object taking over the resources of the original object, taking its' memory
	location.

Question 2: The dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves

Answer: Within this workshop I had to set the resource instance pointer to an address instead of 
copying over the actual objects because dynamic allocation of objects can't occur when they have to be statically
allocated during instantiation - only addresses can be dynamically allocated.
